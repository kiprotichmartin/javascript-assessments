# ASSESSMENT 2 QUESTIONS
## Question one:
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise. 

Example;

Input: x = -121 
Output: false 
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore, it is not a palindrome. 

## Question two;
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well. 

## Question three;
Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it. 

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once. 

Example 

Input: s = "hello" 
Output: "holle"
